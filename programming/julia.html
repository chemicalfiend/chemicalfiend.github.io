<h2>Programming in Julia</h2>

<p> I've been a julia programmer for a couple of years now. Initially, I was using Julia exclusively as a scripting language to automate some tasks for my research work (<a href="github.com/chemicalfiend/md_utils">md_utils</a>). After some time I discovered the JuliaMolSim community, which I've tried working with. So far, I've contributed to the <a href="github.com/JuliaMolSim/Molly.jl">Molly.jl</a> and <a href="github.com/JuliaMolSim/AtomsBase.jl">AtomsBase.jl</a> packages, though I hope to contribute a lot more in the future to the ecosystem as a whole </p>

<br /><br />

<p> My main contribution to this ecosystem was participating in the <b>Julia Summer of Code 2022</b> programme, where I added bond and angle constraint features to the Molly.jl package. You can see my journey through this programme here : <a href="chemicalfiend.github.io/gsoc-path.html">JSoC Journal</a></p>
