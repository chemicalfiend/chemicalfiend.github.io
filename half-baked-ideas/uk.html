        <h1>The United Kingdom</h1>

        I spent 6 months in the UK for my masters thesis and I loved every bit of it. It's a great travel destination. A lot of people ask me where to go and what to see. This is what I did and recommend. I'm not a travel guide of course but these were fun things to do:

        <h2>In and around London</h2>
        
        There's a lot to do around London and if you spent all day everyday going out it'd still take ages to cover everything.

        This page is halfway between a guide to spending time in London and my personal journal detailing things to did and saw.

        <h3>Battersea</h3>
        
        Battersea Park

        Battersea Power Station
        

        <h3>Waterloo and Westminster</h3>
        
        Waterloo Station
        
        Southbank and BFI

        Westminster Abbey

        Trafalgar Square

        Covent Garden
        
        Buckingham Palace

        <h3>Baker Street</h3>
       
        Sherlock Holmes Museum

        Regents Park

        Checking out UCL


        <h3>Catching a show at Piccadilly Circus</h3>

        Walk around SoHo and Chinatown

        Picadilly Circus

        Leicester Square        

        Watch the Book of Mormon! (not family-friendly but the best laugh you'll ever have)

        <h3>City of London Area</h3>

        Tower of London (Koh-i-noor!!)
        
        Tower Bridge
        
        Get a view from Skygarden (which is free unlike the overpriced view from the Shard)       


        <h3>A Day in Greenwich</h3>

        Note : you should go here via ThamesLink and NOT by taking the bus from Peckham. Having done both I can say confidently that the former is a much more pleasing experience than the latter.
        
        Greenwich Market

        Cutty Sark

        Greenwich Park
