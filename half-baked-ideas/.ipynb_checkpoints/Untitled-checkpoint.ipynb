    "Julia is probably my favourite programming language. It's so simple, easy-to-use, versatile and feature-rich. Scientists have for years been using python for ease and C or Fortran for speed, but now you have it all in one package that does everything for you. It's super convenient, super easy and super reliable. "

    "# How I got into Julia\n",
    "\n",
    "I've been a julia programmer for a few years now. Initially, I was using Julia exclusively as a scripting language to automate some tasks for my research work [md_utils](https://github.com/chemicalfiend/md_utils). After some time I discovered the JuliaMolSim community, which I've tried working with. So far, I've contributed to the [Molly.jl](https://github.com/JuliaMolSim/Molly.jl) and [AtomsBase.jl](https://github.com/JuliaMolSim/AtomsBase.jl) packages, though I hope to contribute a lot more in the future to the ecosystem as a whole \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "My main contribution to this ecosystem was participating in the **Julia Summer of Code 2022** programme, where I added bond and angle constraint features to the Molly.jl package.\n",
    "\n",
    "I later worked with the Frost Group at Imperial College London, where I helped develop the group's julia codebase to work on non-adiabatic dynamics and path integral monte carlo simulations to study polarons in semiconductor materials\n"
