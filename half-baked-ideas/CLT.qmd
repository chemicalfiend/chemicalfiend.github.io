# Central Limit Theorem

- Inadequate placeholder for a very interesting "emergent" phenomenon.

TODO 
- [ ] The moments and cumulants of a normal distribution
- [ ] Weak and strong forms of CLT
- [ ] CLT preasymptotics
- [ ] Infinite variance - Levy $\alpha$-stable class.
- [ ] Distribution of sample variance is $\chi^2$.
- [ ] neural networks in large N reveals gaussian process
- [ ] Gaussian noise 
- [ ] CLT in fourier space (zw)
- [ ] Higher moment "effective" gaussian pictures - massaging around higher cumulants (make plots of the first, second and higher order cumulants over sample size and see how the first two cumulants "supplant" the other ones) - true half-baked spirit
- [ ] Tease cumulant expansions with second order truncations.
