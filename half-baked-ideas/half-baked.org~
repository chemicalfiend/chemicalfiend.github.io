* Half-Baked Ideas

It has been a goal of mine for a long time to maintain a set of notebooks with half-baked ideas that I can keep referencing.
I push it to the web so that the same resources are available to others. These are not serious opinion and they
are not part of my official research work. But they are bits of academic or technical curiosity that are as advertised
half-baked and not well-developed notions. They may relate to any one of my several interests in science, mathematics,
engineering, technology, anime, video games, travel and other things.
