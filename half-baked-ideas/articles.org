* Articles I want to write

** Tech / Code
*** Julia
*** Linux
*** Emacs
** Chemical Physics and associated problems
*** Chemphys : what is it?
*** Optoelectronics and Nanophotonics
*** Electrochemistry and dynamics
** Prob / Statistics / Stat Mech
*** Moment Problems
**** Constructing a "unique" distribution from the moments / cumulants (moment problems)
**** One decent way to approximate a distribution from its moments / cumulants 
**** Varying the moments and seeing what happens to the distribution
**** Tail events and tail risk
*** Flavours of CLT
**** Maxwell distribution
**** Gaussian Process NN / Showcase nice GP stuff
**** Variances goes as t-distribution
**** Requires bounded variance - Pareto does not follow CLT and has really interesting outliers.
*** Entropy is not disorder
**** Make a nice package for liquid crystal / colloidal NP simulation
*** Avalanche as a phase transition
** Fluids
*** Transport
*** Navier-Stokes existence and smoothness problems
