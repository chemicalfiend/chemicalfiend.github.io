<h2> Julia Season of Code </h2>

<p> At the end of the MIT 18.065 playlist, Professor Gilbert Strang had Alan Edelman come and talk about the Julia programming language for scientific computing. Subsequently, a lot of Julia-heavy content started to flood my recommendations, including interviews with Viral Shah and Edelman's TED talk. 3Blue1Brown's creator Grant Sanderson (one of my favourite YouTubers and a genuine inspiration to math and physics education throughout the world) conducted the Computational Thinking course in Julia too. This got me interested in the Julia programming language. Towards the end of my second year, I started taking a serious interest in Julia and wanted to learn about how to use it to implement schemes that ran quickly. </p>

<p>It didn't take long before I realised that the Julia community was a great space to contribute to, since a lot of tools were still up and coming. After attending the Chemistry BoF session in JuliaCon 2021, I decided that I wanted to contribute to the chemistry and materials science space in Julia. It was around the same time that I was working on a project in my university related to Molecular Dynamics. I started looking for MD tools in Julia and I found Molly.jl, which was still in its early stages of development. I jumped right in and contacted the maintainer, Dr. Joe Greener asking him about how I could contribute to this project. It took a while before I could get a hang of working with Julia packages and environments but learning about working with it was definitely a riveting experience </p> 

<p> Eventually I decided to partake in the Julia Season of Code event for 2022, running across the entire summmer. I wrote a proposal related to constrained dynamics and it got accepted! I started a journal page on this blog for tracking my own progress and work as I went along, which can be found <a href="https://chemicalfiend.github.io/gsoc-path.html">here</a> </p>
