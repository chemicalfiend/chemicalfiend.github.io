SPOILER ALERT! - there are going to be spoilers here for the One Piece anime and manga. If you haven't read either I wouldn't go past probably the first one or two sections of this page.

This is a massive project to-do on all my thoughts and my review on One Piece, probably the grandest project that the anime and manga industry has ever tried. I plan to do both an overall "thoughts" section and an arc-by-arc review of One Piece. Of course I hope to rewatch / re-read the arcs that I am discussing as I go over them.
