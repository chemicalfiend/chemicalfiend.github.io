    <h3><b>PR#44 added velocity autocorrelation</b></h3>

    <p> Coordinate, Temperature and Energy loggers were already implemented in Molly.jl and working well. However for analysis, it helps to have a velocity logger to calculate the velocity autocorrelation function, which is a good measure of "memory" for non-equilibrium systems where properties change with respect to time. In <a href="https://github.com/JuliaMolSim/Molly.jl/pull/44">PR #44</a> I implemented the velocity logger and velocity autocorrelation function</p>



    <h3><b>PR#52 Morse bonded interaction</b></h3>

    <p> MorseBond was added to Molly sequence, following the similar pattern compared to structure HarmonicBond. This is a potential that accurately resembles the experimental potential vs bond energy graph. </p>
