    <h2>Philosophy Catalogue</h2>

    This is a catalogue of some texts I'm reading / have read in philosophy and hopefully I'll be able to write some brief notes for each of them in the future, perhaps on re-reads.

    <ul>
        <li> Meditations on First Philosophy - Rene Descartes </li>
        
        <li> The Republic - Plato </li>

        <li> Meditations - Marcus Aurelius </li>

    </ul>

</body>
