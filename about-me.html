<h1> About Me </h1>

</center>

<br><br>

<p> My name is Pranay Venkatesh. I am an undergraduate student in Birla
Institute of Technology and Science, Pilani double majoring in chemistry and
chemical engineering.</p>

<br>

<p> I am interested in pursuing research in computational materials science,
theoretical chemistry, soft matter and microfluidics. I am also keen on working
in the dissemination of scientific knowledge </p>

<p> My preference in as much as possible is minimalism. I like things that
function more than things that look nice and I hope to devote at least a part
of my life to developing a layer of minimalism and simplicity that follows
everything else I do </p>

<p> I also like watching anime and have offlate developed a keen interest in
hobbyist electronics and embedded systems. </p>
