<h1> [IDEA] OSmium : The Computational Chemist's Fully Configured Operating System </h1>


<p> Of late, I've been very annoyed at how difficult it is to install and maintain
software for computational chemistry. Free software by itself can be very
annoying, proprietary software probably gets worse, though I don't have
sufficient experience with proprietary software to comment. </p>


<p> At the back of my mind I've always had this desire nagging me at the back of my
head : what if an operating system came fully loaded with computational
chemistry packages pre-installed or at least pre-configured, ready to install
at any time? Obviously, it's a linux distribution, with a standard package
manager. On top of that package manager would be an extra package manager
that's specific for chemistry / materials science software. A neat name for
this distro is OSmium Linux. And I want to call the package manager tpm (or
tetroxide package manager)  <p>
