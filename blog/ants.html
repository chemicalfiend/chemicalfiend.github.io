    <H1> Ants </H1>

    <p> Ants. Tiny little bugs that crawl around all over the place. Their power lies not just in their tough body that can last bashes and cuts and tug a lot of weight, but also in their
    sheer numbers. They crawl in masses and conquer everything from the tiniest speck of sugar that drops to the floor to an entire box filled with sweets </p>

    <p> My personal experiences with ants has left me simultaneously fascinated and frustrated. In my house, ants do not hesitate before they devour an entire box of food, sweet or savoury.
    But it gets worse! Ants have eaten up 2 chargers, one desktop, several plug points and one laptop. Let me tell you, it wasn't just any laptop, this is a thinkpad we're talking about here.
    My father's prized possession : the ThinkPad carbon X1. If you don't know anything about ThinkPads, they are extremely rugged, extremely long-lasting laptops with beautiful keyboards that 
    just WORK, for months and years, they consistently give you performance and do not die out. From my personal experience, ThinkPads are timeless, waterproof and even fall-proof, I've found
    multiple ways to drop a laptop by accident and the thinkpads always survived them. But the one thing the ThinkPad could not conquer was the ant. </p>

    <p> One day, my father tries to boot his ThinkPad up, thinking it's business as usual, but the darn thing doesn't start. We try a variety of diagnostic methods to see if we can fix the thing
    but none of the usual ones seem to work. The light turns on but the monitor doesn't come on. So we pull out our old HDMI cable and hook the laptop up to a monitor. We see a few glitchy images but
    nothing conclusive. My mind internally has already concluded that it's a driver issue and that a software compatibility fix should ease everything up. Later that day, we open up the laptop
    to find...you guessed it...ants. Several hundreds of them. They have feasted away at the motherboard and left eggs all over the place. They seem to have confused the silica used to make semiconductors
    for their sand homes in the dirt. We're still yet to give the ThinkPad for repairs, so we have to see what happens when we actually fix it up. </p>

    <p> This, of course, is not our first encounter. In fact this time were only surprised because of the sheer scale of the problem but not by the underlying cause itself. The curious case of
    the smoking master bedroom plugpoint for example (I need a better name for it, don't I) is a perplexing example of the proclivity of ants to feast on electrical items. One hot day, we want to up the fan speed,
    so we turn the knob that regulates fan speed. Surprisingly, we start to smell a bit of smoke. We look around and suddenly realise that the plugpoint is smoking. So in a hurry I switch off the fan, along with all
    the other switches there. The thing continues to smoke for a while and a bit later we sense the foul odour of melting plastic. We open up the plugpoint to see that the ants have chewed away
    at the cable that leads away from the fan speed regulator, causing some kind of short circuit or something of that nature. </p>

    <p> In another occassion, a laptop charger stopped working and nearly exploded too! And yet again, we open it up to find ants. We have tried every possible measure to rid our walls and our floors
    of ants but they seem to hide away in some crack of the wall, breeding and building up their armies to fight again. We don't see them for most of the day but when we do, we discover that they
    have conquered our food or our electrical / electronic devices. </p>

    <p> I still haven't mentioned the most surprising thing I've seen an ant do. In university, I was sitting in my friend's room one day and a large ant suddenly showed up. My friend took a bucket 
    and slammed its rim on the ant, splitting it into two. We were ready to put it out of its misery by just stomping it, but we didn't. The ant literally pulled itself together. The limbs on its top half
    yanked its bottom half up and reattached itself and then proceeded to walk away, albeit slowly. It was unbelievable. Looking back, it's still unbelievable. I haven't really checked if anyone has conclusively
    researched on ant reattachment but if they haven't they should! </p>

    <p> In summary, ants are dangerous, they are fierce, their sheer numbers always win. However, as a scientist I can't help but look at them and wonder if we could learn a thing or two more from them, maybe try
    to emulate their sheer biomechanical strength or see if we could reattach our own chopped off body parts! I even wonder if we could be as organised as they are, working together to serve a common purpose, continuously repopulating
    and finding food and then repeating it again and again and again. Ants...sigh. </p>
