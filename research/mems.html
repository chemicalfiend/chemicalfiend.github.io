<h2>Nano-scale Transport and MEMS/NEMS Projects and Research</h2>

<h3>What is this??</h3>

<p> Microelectromechanical Systems or MEMS for brevity and catchiness is an interdisciplinary field dealing with microsystems that have mechanical and electrical components. MEMS devices are slowly becoming the next generation of silicon technology in the world. Typically these devices have sensing and actuating elements that serve various engineering applications but as usual I'm more interested in the science at the micro-scale. One aspect about MEMS science is to understand material properties and the second is understanding microfluidics.</p>


<p>When fluid flow systems scale down, surface effects tend to dominate over bulk volume effects. When this happens, our models for macroscale systems start to break down and no longer serve as reasonable estimates for realistic conditions. Below are some projects where I have attempted to model micro and nano-scale fluid systems.</p>

<h3>Molecular Dynamics Study of Liquids under Ultra-Confinement (Study Project)</h3>

This was a study project that I took in 4th year of my undergraduate degree. In this project we analysed the properties of evaporation of a film of liquid argon in the nanoscale in the presence of a platinum solid in various geometries and flow regimes.

<h3>Smart Insoles for Shock Absorption (Intro to MEMS course project)</h3>

In progress....

<h3>Effective Models for Momentum Transport in Solid-Liquid Interfaces in MEMS Devices (Transport Phenomena course project)</h3>
